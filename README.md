# Question-Answering with Transformers and Streamlit

This project is a Streamlit web application that uses Hugging Face's Transformers library to perform question-answering on a given text passage. Users can paste an article, ask a question, and get an answer from the application.

## Overview

### Question Answering with Transformers

Question answering is a natural language processing task where a machine is tasked with answering questions posed in natural language. Transformers, especially pre-trained models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and its variants, have shown remarkable performance on QA tasks.

In this project, we use the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides pre-trained models and easy-to-use pipelines for various NLP tasks, including question answering.

### Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that allows you to create interactive web applications for machine learning and data science projects. With Streamlit, you can quickly build user interfaces for your Python scripts and deploy them as web apps without having to write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

In this project, we use Streamlit to create a simple web interface where users can input a text passage and ask questions. The application then uses a pre-trained transformer model to provide answers to the questions.
